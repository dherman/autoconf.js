# autoconf.js

*by [Dave Herman](http://blog.mozilla.com/dherman)*

A portable JavaScript library for dynamically querying the host environment for various ECMAScript/JavaScript language features.

Think of it as either:

* [autoconf](http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/) for the web, or
* [object detection](http://www.quirksmode.org/js/support.html) on steroids

Right now, `autoconf.js` only queries for features. It might be developed to provide shims for various concepts that can be expressed differently depending on detected features.
